# Objectives

This project aims to predict sport results (especially European football and tennis) based on historical results and statistics thanks to Machine Learning methods.
A secondary objective would be to design a Betting AI which selects its bets and manages its risk exposure.

# Datasets
To do so, you will find in the repo some data gathered since 2000. You can find those data as csv before any processing on the following website :

## Notes for Football Data

All data is in csv format, ready for use within standard spreadsheet applications. Please note that some abbreviations are no longer in use (in particular odds from specific bookmakers no longer used) and refer to data collected in earlier seasons.
